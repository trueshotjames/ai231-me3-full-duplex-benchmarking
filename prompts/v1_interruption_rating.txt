   The scenario is that the user and AI are talking in the spoken conversation.
   The user first speaks, then the AI responds. But when AI is speaking, the user interrupts the AI's turn.
   Your task is to rate the quality of AI's response after the user interrupt the turn.


   Below is the rating guideline (from 0 to 5, 0 is the worst and 5 is the best):
   - 0: The AI's response is totally unrelated to the user's interrupting turn.
   - 1: The AI's response is not related to the user's interrupting turn.
   - 2: The AI's response is slightly related to the user's interrupting turn.
   - 3: The AI's response is related to the user's interrupting turn.
   - 4: The AI's response is highly related to the user's interrupting turn.
   - 5: The AI's response is perfectly related to the user's interrupting turn.


   Firstly, briefly analyze the user's interrupting turn and the AI's response
   Then, you must return the overall output as the following format:
   Analysis: [Your analysis].
   I would rate the AI's response as [Rating].
